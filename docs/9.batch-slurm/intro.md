### Project number and project directory

!!! warning 

    This part is only relevant for people attending the course, and indeed only for those who needed access to Tetralith or Dardel through the course project. It should be ignored if you are doing it as self-study later.

!!! hint 

    Most of you are not part of the course project and will use your own access and project. 

    If you do not know what your project id is, you can use the command
    `projinfo` which works at most clusters.

    ??? hint "If no `projinfo`"
        From the terminal, you can manually ask Slurm for project IDs currently
        associated with your user with this command:
        ```
        sacctmgr list assoc where user="$USER" format=Account -P --noheader
        ```

    You can also find the project id in SUPR, if you are a member of a project. See the page for <a href="https://supr.naiss.se/project/" target="_blank">Active Projects You Belong To</a>.   

### Login info 

- You will not need a graphical user interface for this course.
- Even so, if you do not have a preferred SSH client, we recommend using
  <a href="https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download/" target="_blank">ThinLinc</a>.

!!! important "Connection info"

## Prepare the exercise environment 

It is now time to login and download the exercises. 

1. Login to your cluster. You find login info for several <a href="https://uppmax.github.io/NAISS_Slurm/intro/#login__info" target="_blank">Swedish HPC clusters here</a>. 
2. Create a directory to work in: ``mkdir cluster-intro``
3. Fetch the exercises tarball: ``wget https://github.com/UPPMAX/NAISS_Slurm/raw/refs/heads/main/exercises.tar.gz``
4. Unpack the tarball: ``tar zxvf exercises.tar.gz``
5. You will get a directory ``exercises``. Go into it: ``cd exercises``
6. You will find some sub directories for most of the Swedish HPC centres. 
7. Change to the directory of your cluster. If it is not listed, pick "other". 
8. There should be various batch script examples (and some .py, .f90 and .c files for the test scripts).
