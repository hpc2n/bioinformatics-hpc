# Introduction to clusters

This section is a beginner's guide to clusters, and provides general information
about computer clusters like Tetralith, Dardel, Alvis, Cosmos, Pelle, Kebnekaise and other HPC systems, but is not directly focused on any of them.

## What is a cluster

A computer cluster consists of a number of computers (few or many), linked
together and working closely together. In many ways, the computer cluster works
as a single computer. Generally, the component-computers are connected to each
other through fast local area networks (LANs).

The advantage of computer clusters over single computers, are that they usually
improves the performance (and availability) greatly, while still being cheaper
than single computers of comparable speed and size.

### What are Nodes, Cores, and CPUs?

A node is the name usually used for one unit (usually one computer) in a
computer cluster. Generally, this computer will have one or two central
processing units, or CPUs, each normally with (many) more than one core. Each
core is a single processor able to handle a single programmed task. Memory is
always shared between cores on the same CPU, but generally not between the CPUs.
Computer nodes can also have GPUs (graphical processing units) in addition to
the CPUs.

Nodes in computer clusters are usually arranged in racks at a dedicated climate-
controlled facility, and are connected via a communication network. With few
exceptions, nearly all high-performance computer clusters use the Linux operating system. Normally, clusters have some sort of batch or queuing system to handle
scheduling of jobs. On Linux systems, that batch or queuing system is most often
Slurm (the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management).

## What is a Supercomputer? Is it the same as a Cluster?

A supercomputer is simply a computer with a processing capacity (generally
calculation speed) several orders of magnitude better than a typical personal
computer. For many years, supercomputers were single computers with many CPUs
and usually large volumes of shared memory---sometimes built specifically for a
certain task. They have often been custom-built machines, like Cray, and still
sometimes are. However, since desktop computers have become cheaper, most
supercomputers today are made up of many "off the shelf" ordinary computers
connected in parallel.

A supercomputer is not the same as a computer cluster, though a computer
cluster is often a supercomputer.

## How is a job run on a computer cluster? What is a batch system?

In general, jobs are run with a batch- or queuing system. There are several
variants of these, with the most common working by having the user log into a
"login node" and then assembling and submitting their jobs from there.

A "job script" (also called a "submission script") will typically be used to
start a job. A job script is essentially a list of commands to the batch system
telling it things like: 
- how many nodes to use,
- how many CPU and/or GPU cores,
- how much memory to allocate,
- how long to run (maximum),
- the program name,
- any input data, etc.

When the job has finished running, it should have produced some files, like output
data, perhaps error messages, etc. The syntax of job scripts depends on the
queuing system, but that system is so often Slurm that you may see the terms
"job script" and "slurm script" used interchangeably.

Since jobs are queued internally and will run whenever the resources for them
become available, programs requiring any kind of user interaction are usually
not recommended (and often not possible) to be run via a job script. There are
special programs like Open On-Demand and GfxLauncher that allow graphical
programs to be run as scheduled jobs on some HPC clusters, but it is up to the
administrators to decide which programs can be run with these tools, how they
should be configured, and what options regular users will be allowed to set.

## Which programs can be run effectively on a computer cluster?

Computer clusters are made up of many interconnected nodes, each with a limited
number of cores and limited memory capacity. The main way an HPC cluster lets you
speed up computations is by letting you execute several tasks in parallel. In other
words, a problem must somehow be split into many tasks to gain any speed-up. 

### Many serial jobs

Running many independent tasks can be done faster on a computer
cluster. No special programming is needed, but you can only run on one core for
each task. It is good for long-running single-threaded jobs. This type of workflow
is good for problems like parameter sweeps, where the same code is run repeatedly
with different inputs.

A job scheduler is used to control the flow of tasks. Using a small script, many
instances of the same task (like a program run many times, each with slightly
different parameters) can be set up. The tasks will be put in a job queue, and
will run as free spaces open up in the queue. Normally, the tasks will run many
at a time, since they are serial, which means each only uses one core.

!!! Example

    You launch 500 tasks (say, run a small program for 500 different temperatures).
    There are 50 cores on the machine in our example, that you can access. Fifty
    instances are started and then run, while the remaining 450 tasks wait. When
    the running programs finish, the next 50 will start, and so on.
    
    It will be is as if you ran on 50 computers instead of one, and you will finish
    in 1/50th of the time.
    
    Of course, this is an ideal example. In reality there may be overhead, waiting
    time between batches of jobs, etc. so the speed-up will not be as great, but it
    will certainly run faster.

## Parallelization

Parallelization can be done in several ways:

- Inside a node: threaded/shared memory
- Across several nodes: distributed parallelism (generally done with MPI or similar.)
- Some combination of threaded and distributed parallelism (hard)

Which is best depends on the size of each parallel process and whether or to what
extent the processes have to communicate.

### What kinds of programs can be parallelized?

For a problem to be parallelizable, it must be possible to split it into smaller
sections that can be solved independently of each other and then combined.

What happens in a parallel program is generally the following:

- A "master" process is created to control the distribution of data and tasks.
- The "master" sends data and instructions to one or more "worker" processes that do the calculations.
- The "worker" processes then send the results back to the "master".
- The "master" combines the results and/or may send out further subsections of the problem to be solved.

Examples of parallel problems:

- Sorting
- Rendering computer graphics
- Computer simulations comparing many independent scenarios, like climate models
- Matrix Multiplication

### Shared memory/thread parallelism

Shared memory is memory that can be accessed by several programs at the same
time, enabling them to communicate quickly and avoid redundant copies. Shared
memory generally refers to a block of RAM accessible by several cores in a
multi-core system. Computers with large amounts of shared memory and many cores
per node are well suited for threaded programs, using OpenMP or similar.

Computer clusters built up of many off-the-shelf computers usually have smaller
amounts of shared memory and fewer cores per node than custom-built single
supercomputers. This means they are more suited for programs using MPI than
OpenMP. However, the number of cores per node is going up and many-core chips
are now common. This means that OpenMP programs as well as programs combining
MPI and OpenMP are often advantageous.

### Distributed parallelism

While shared memory parallelism works well inside a node, you need distributed parallelism if you want to scale to more cores than are in a node. 

This is often done with MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries. Processes/workers exchange information by sending and receiving messages/data. They can also share some memory. 

You need to write your code so it uses MPI or use software that is already prepared for it. 

### Hybrid parallelism

Sometimes code can be more efficient when using both OpenMP and MPI. This is called hybrid parallelism. 

### GPUs

Many computer clusters have GPUs in several of their nodes that jobs may
take advantage of.

Originally, GPUs were used for computer graphics, but now they are also used
extensively for general-purpose computing (GPGPU computing).

GPU-driven parallel computing is, among other things, used for:

- scientific modeling
- machine learning
- graphical rendering

and other parallelizable jobs.

#### Difference between CPUs and GPUs

CPUs (Central Processing Units) are latency-optimized general-purpose processors
designed to handle a wide range of distinct tasks sequentially.

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are throughput-optimized specialized processors
designed for high-end parallel computing.

Whether you should use a CPU, a GPU, or both depends on the specifics of the
problem you are solving.

#### Using GPUs

Programs must be written especially for GPUs in order to use them.

Several programming frameworks handle the graphical primitives that GPUs
understand, like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), OpenCL, OpenACC,
HIP, etc.

In addition to the above programming frameworks, you often have the option to
use software that is already prepared for use on GPUs. This includes many types
of MD software, Python packages, and others.
